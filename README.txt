How to compile/run code:
1. Run the GameCenter-setup.py script.
2. If the script has run correctly, the database should be set up and website should be running.
To connect, type 'localhost:8080/' in the address bar.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** If there were trouble creating the database/running the program due to the database:
Both the python script and java code connect to a specific MySQL server used during implementation.

Inside the java code,
There is a DatabaseManager.class file. That class sets up the specific database
(using localhost as the host, root as the user, and z*>L?yZc=3Z%b9b8R,9e4V@X as the password)
These values would be changed depending on the database server to connect to.

Inside the python code,
The database is set up using bash shell commands. Change the parameters to match that of the
desired server.
